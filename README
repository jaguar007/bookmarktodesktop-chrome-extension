Chrome extension for Bookmark to Desktop
========================================

Google Chrome/Chromium extension for the Bookmark to Desktop service.
The service allows android users to send links from their android phone
to their desktop browser.

At this stage the extension does two things:

1) it polls the server every 30 minutes for new bookmarks, if new bookmarks
   are found they are saved into the bookmarktodesktop folder on the bookmarks
   bar

2) If the extension is registered towards the service when the user sends a 
   link from his phone to the browser, then the link will immediately open
   in a new tab. The 'push' from server to extension happens through the google
   appengine channel api
